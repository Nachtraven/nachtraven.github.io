Always wanted my own machine tools, initially build myself a very poorly designed CNC as a kid, and more recently a toolchanging 3D printer.
This HBM Profi Norton 250 x 550 is my first real "machine" tool, and priced acceptably at 1100 eur

Placing the lathe on a strong surface that it can be bolted to helped enormoysly. Leveling was difficult and required puchasing proper shims.
A quick change toolpost is a must

Final toolpost is an Aa Max from Gedeihen on aliexpress. Be sure to shop around to not overpay

Has been working well from the limited experience I have had with it
