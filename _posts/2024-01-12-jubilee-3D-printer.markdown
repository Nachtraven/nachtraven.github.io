Wanting something custom and enjoying the process of design and engineering, as many others I wanted to make my own 3D printer.
This started in 22, took about a year and was originally independently made. Later, elements of the [Jubilee project](https://jubilee3d.com) were added.

Initial specs were a print plate of 40x40x40cm, with 6 tools. The design for manufacturing goal was to use 50cm 2020 alu extrusions, no cnc parts and minimize 3d printed part use

Remote elastic twist lock was a major improvement to my design.

During this time, the prusa design was also unveiled and released to the public

Eventually, I decided to downsize to a jubilee design, then to a voron V0.2 due to lacking space
