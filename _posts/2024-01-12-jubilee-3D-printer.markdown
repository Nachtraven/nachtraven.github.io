For my Voron V0, I chose to rebuild a secondhand kit and upgrade it with high CRI LEDs for the bed and hotend, a volcano hotend, bimetallic heatbreak, LGX lite and a full sized hat. Most interesting is the volcano hotend on a voron V0.2, so I focus on that:

The original had a lot of problems, so many parts were swapped and upgraded.

Starting from a regular volcano, with an upgraded bi-metallic heatbreak, I sawed off the upper section closest to the mounting head. Two holes are then drilled and tapped, and one side needs to be sanded down (after tapping to ensure the orientation)

LEDs were added to the head

The electricals were upgraded:

A full sized hat was added using 2020 extrusions, as well as a chamber thermostat. Both essentia in my opinion as it allows to heatsoak before a print.

Has some VFA

Wanting something custom and enjoying the process of design and engineering, as many others have, I wanted to make my own 3D printer. I've owned quite a few, and wanted my own Toolchanger as a tinker project..

My toolchanger started in 22, took about a year and was originally independently developped, I then integrated some elements of the [Jubilee project](https://jubilee3d.com).

Initial specs were a print plate of 40x40x40cm, with 6 tools. The design for manufacturing goal was to use 50cm 2020 alu extrusions, no cnc parts and minimize 3d printed part use

Remote elastic twist lock was a major improvement to my design that I adopted.

During this time, the prusa design was also unveiled and released to the public.

My own "jubilee" style printer:
