Pulled a MES-DEA motor, gearbox, controller and anscilliary components from a crash damaged vehicle
Planned to put it in a Fiat 126

Opening up the gearbox to inspect what may need to be changed to allow reverse operation, as it is not supposed to turn backwards per the manual.

Finding the TIM600Handbook_7.2E.pdf is useful

Mounting it this way will fail inspection. Laws have changed in Belgium over the course of the project, requiring multiple reworks. 
Current rules are no chassis modifications, only re-use existing bolt points, no more than 10% weight increase per axle.

The above mounting also has the downside of being reverse direction compared to what is stated in the manual. When opening, I did not identify clear issues with oil path. I'll need to reach out to someone more knowledgeable to ask about what can be done to have the gearbox reliably run in reverse.

Getting it all laid out and wired up to HV, I got to test the motor, controller and my simplified wiring:

And a short video, it is an incredibly loud motor/motor controller. Note I was using here a much lower voltage than the motor was originally programmed for, so that may be playing into it too. these tests were ran at approximately 80v which is the highest my temporary setup could go.
