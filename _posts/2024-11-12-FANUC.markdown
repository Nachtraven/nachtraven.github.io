This Fanuc arm was up for auction for 100â‚¬, seemed like an interesting purchase.
No controller was included, but overall opening it up has already been interesting, I look forward to reverse engineering it a bit to see if I can run it! Kinematics will be a challenge. 
Seller told me he'd "Reach out if I find the controller" as if it was something that could be forgotten about under a rug.

Opening the arm up and I find datecodes for 1997, a bit older than the listing that stated early 2000s

The Fanuc servos are AC, Model Beta 0.5/3000 and made in japan.

If you have more deep knowledge or instructions on these I'm all ears
