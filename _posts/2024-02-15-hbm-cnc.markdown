Always wanted my own machine tools, previously purchased a lathe and wanted a cnc to machine parts not doable on a drill press/with a dremel
This CNC is based on the HBM BF25, the conversion was started by someone else.

It used a "DCNC ISEL complete ballscrew kit for BF20" - around 800â‚¬ just for the ballscrews! Thankfully these are high quality.

I have since completed the conversion and cleaned it up for tighter tolerances
Still needs to be encased to avoid aluminium filings flying everywhere

Using the lathe to make parts for the CNC. 
Still needs work!
