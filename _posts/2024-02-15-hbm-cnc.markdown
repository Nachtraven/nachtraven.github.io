Always wanted my own machine tools, previously purchased a lathe and wanted a cnc to machine parts not doable on a drill press/with a dremel
This CNC is based on the HBM BF25, the conversion was started by someone else.

It used a "DCNC ISEL complete ballscrew kit for BF20" - around 800€ just for the ballscrews! Thankfully these are high quality.

I have since completed the conversion and cleaned it up for tighter tolerances
Still needs to be encased to avoid aluminium filings flying everywhere

Using the lathe to make parts for the CNC. 
Still needs work!

The electronics are running a PoKeys CNC 1.2

And MSD 50 5.6 stepper drivers, with meanwell 12V power supplies

Wiring is a bit messy overall, but this is a handover from the previous owners work

The on board computer is quite ancient, and has now been upgraded to an SSD, as it was dying

4GB DDR3 and C-70 APU, a dual core laptop cpu. When changing to the SSD following the hard drive repeatedly crashing its read head, I used windows 7 (32 bit!)
