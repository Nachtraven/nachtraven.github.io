I wanted a front/back dashcam for my motorcycle, that wouldn't break the bank and was easily integrated. Aliexpress has some ones available, this one is clearly originally a car model! I am also not sure I'd pay more for the waterproof version.
Total installation time ~2h30

The purchased aliexpress model. Nowadays aliexpress prices vary wildly from week to week, and have generally gone up. There is probably a better deal to be found elsewhere. Don't forget to buy a decent 64GB sd card, detailed later is the drive time this provides.

Starting with the rear cam, to run the wire you need to fully take apart the rear fender.

This allows you to run the wire alongside the wire for the plate lighting. Make sure to use heatshrink after you have run the wires!

Front cam is currently between the forks, tbd if this is too dirty for long term use. Will also end up wrapping this cable section to protect it.
