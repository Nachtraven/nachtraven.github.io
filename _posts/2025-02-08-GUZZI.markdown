I wanted a front/back dashcam for my motorcycle, that wouldn't break the bank and was easily integrated. Aliexpress has some ones available, this one is clearly originally a car model! I am also not sure I'd pay more for the waterproof version.
Total installation time ~2h30

The purchased aliexpress model. Nowadays aliexpress prices vary wildly from week to week, and have generally gone up. There is probably a better deal to be found elsewhere. Don't forget to buy a decent 64GB sd card, detailed later is the drive time this provides.

Starting with the rear cam, to run the wire you need to fully take apart the rear fender. Needed to enlarge the holes and used a file, would recommend here just using a 6mm drill bit. Would avoid damaging the housing!

This allows you to run the wire alongside the wire for the plate lighting. You need to take absolutely everything apart and be sure to zip tie the two wires together properly. Make sure to use heatshrink on the connector after you have run the wires! I added silicone grease too.

Front cam is currently between the forks, tbd if this is too dirty for long term use. Will also end up wrapping this cable section to protect it.

Powering the dashcam, I used the two pin switched connector under the seat, it is a Superseal AMP Tyco Fiat 2-pin connector. Luckily I had a three pin version laying around that I took the wires out of, although in de-pinning the connector I ended up having to cut the plastic housing. The current draw of the cam is minimal. 

You will need about 275mb/3minute clip per camera or about 183mb/minute for both cameras.

Front example:

Rear example (I installed it upside down):

You won't be reading nuberplates from afar, and you do get vibration artifacts. Having sound is a nice bonus, but you don't hear much beyond the engine rumble.
