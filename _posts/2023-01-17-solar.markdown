# Pitfalls of our Solar Install
Test post.
End of 2022 we finally got a solar installation set up after quite a few quotes.

Total cost was as follows: Inverter STP 8.0 3120€, SMA Home manager 720€ and 22 Panels 410wp + install was 9561€. Cost was substantially increased due to ordering inverter separately as I didn't want a huauwei model (would have saved ~2000€)
13401€, at a current cost of energy of 55 cents during the day will take ~24365kwh generated to pay itself back. Total from the 14th of Dec to 21st of feb is 349kwh. Payback time of ~4685 days or just under 13 years at winter production levels!

This will be substantially improved once we trim the tree in front of the panels, with a battery and once sunnier weather arrives.

Our heatpump uses a lot of power, I would highly recommend springing for a geothermal model!

SMA also doesn't make it easy to integrate a Smart Grid ready heatpump (although daikin doesn't either!). Future post about doing this is in the works.
